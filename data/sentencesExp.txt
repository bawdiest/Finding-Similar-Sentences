12 the ddg 1000 cannot perform area air defense specifically it cannot successfully employ the standard missile sm 2 sm 3 or sm 6 and is incapable of conducting ballistic missile defense although superior in littoral asw the ddg 1000 lower power sonar design is less effective in the blue water than ddg 51 capability ddg 1000s advanced gun system ags design provides enhanced naval fires support capability in the littorals with increased survivability however with the accelerated advancement of precision munitions and targeting excess fires capacity already exists from tactical aviation and organic usmc fires unfortunately the ddg 1000 design sacrifices capacity for increased capability in an area where navy already has and is projected to have sufficient capacity and capability
13 for four weeks between may and june we had decc officers on 24 hour call in the field to respond to resident odour complaints and to monitor contributing factors such as location and wind
14 during the course of our investigations we located one industry where the odour controls were not working correctly and we are now making sure that the company rectifies this
15 both of these businesses are co operating with decc staff to help eliminate any potential contributions they may be making towards rutherfords odour issues and thats a very positive outcome
16 we were able to analyse four samples from our odour capturing canisters used during the survey however none of these came from residential areas and with the exception of the samples obtained from hunter water corporations sewer system were in fact typical of busy roads
17 based on the diversity of complaints both in odour types and location we knew that this would not be a simple matter of finding one single source instead it is most likely a combination of processes from a combination of industries
18 hopefully by working with the industries in rutherford to ensure that the correct odour controls are in place we can eliminate the offensive smells as much as possible
19 just notice your breath repeatedly constantly start with a few minutes do it regularly daily everyday no days off if you miss a day dont ruminate too much just pick it up and start again keeping it regular is very important it will bring order and a restfulness to your life off of the cushion as it were
20 i would like to speak a moment about this concept of community as a meditator you are not alone you are not selfish because you take the time to notice your thoughts in fact you will come to see if you sit with any real regularity and commitment that your time sitting will alter maybe even transform your life with others in very beneficial harmonious ways i do not want to give you the impression that everything will be perfect and pleasant henceforward no this is not any humans reality that i have met and i have met the lowest and the highest of the caste no i just wanted to make certain that you heard the report from the front lines as it were that you are not alone ever never no how
21 there is nothin like that crack of the bat at the park it is probably my favorite sound of the park its not the same on broadcast no matter what kind of system you put it through ambience echo cracker jacks i dont care if i ever get back
22 yah i picked this white one up last year i wear it when i think they are going to win i wear the grey when they are destined to lose i think ill have to wear the grey one more
23 so do you find you get more comments from people when you were either color
24 yah definetly the white one gets more guys staring at me those boys sneer occasionally at the grey one but the white one is more noticeable much more piratey looking if they ever drop the price on em or do another one hey maybe you and viv could do one with maybe less quality ah but youd probably go in the other direction and line em with sensors well maybe all i am saying is they could take off as a weird trend
25 exactly ok so what are your top ten fenway sounds today
26 in no particular order no wait i think i can order them
27 common ma can i get a coffee i am too old enough to drink
28 hey braid what can you tell me about the whereabouts of a guy named rockrock ring any bells
29 ya rockrock viv must have let on to you about the package i received the other day it was dropped in at her uncles place im not certain how anyone knew we were there but it was clearly for me for us and there was a picture the picture was of cocoa and me taken about a month ago
30 compro what no we were just having a snack down by the harbor
31 i mean anything technologically compromising like maybe how did that photo get taken without either of you knowing it was being taken that kind of compromising
32 oh yah well since you put it that way yes very compromising
33 oh in that instance yah i think i know who this rockrock person maybe
34 police are of the opinion that although the options of avos and the like are being pursued it will not deter those persons residing in willow drive from harassing the couple
35 police are fearful that the violence may get out of hand and the best way to avoid this is through relocation
36 vet tenants more thoroughly and not use our area as a dumping ground for troublemakers
37 but it wasnt like that for us last christmas when all my kids presents were broken or stolen and our house was damaged by fire
38 we had been out on christmas day returning to find our house had been trashed
39 we had been inside for only a few minutes before people began throwing bricks at the building
40 i ran out with my 18 month old baby in my arms my other children following
41 the taxi driver waiting for us was astonished at what was happening
42 our families are all safe now and i want nothing from anybody
43 but i feel i must speak up now or i will have it on my conscience forever if i keep quiet and someone is killed in willow drive
44 living there can be a nightmare and i feel so sorry for people who still live with all those troubles
45 i was targeted because i am against drugs so i became the worst person in the world to many people there
46 no one in the street will talk to police because they are so frightened
47 people are fighting all over the place and it is getting out of hand
48 the department of housing is putting bad people in here without checking on their past history
49 my idea of hell is being photographed so maybe we can consider this my therapy session but im really looking forward to seeing how the artists view me because hopefully theyll be kinder to me than i am on myself and thats part of the therapy
50 ive been listening to carol on the radio for years but ive never seen her so this has been a great experience
51 because when you listen to someone on the radio for quite some time you can get a preconceived idea of what the face on the end of that voice may look like
52 one of the things that makes it okay is that as opposed to being photographed youre being captured by someone else the only view of a photograph is the one you put on it yourself so this is my opportunity to see what other people see
53 also how often in life do you get to do something like this my reaction to the whole thing has been yes then no yes then no but its a great privilege i mean when was the last time someone rang up and said hey can i paint your head
54 and for people who have life long self esteem problems i think something like this helps even if they turn you inside out and flip you on your head
55 this is why i work in radio and not television

66 its a difficult thing for disability business services to market to the community because were so diverse and the community dont really have an understanding of what we do
67 the funding is a good recognition from the government that this is a worthwhile venture
68 disability services like mai wel need to market themselves and sometimes they have a limited capacity to do so
69 this is a one off grant to up their activity on the marketing side
70 this of course will hopefully grow their business and provide greater opportunities for them to expand
71 theres nothing more important in disability services than providing the challenge and opportunity to work in mainstream australia
72 the staff are very excited about going in as are the residents and the families
73 it brings us right up and into the 21st century
74 benhome provides a wonderful service to the local community and this further enhances what theyre able to do
75 all governments are appreciative of not for profit organisations like the one here helping to engage the local community in the financial support of these facilities
76 there shouldnt be any greater priority for government than to take care of elderly australians those who have contributed so much to the development of the nation
77 weve got a rapidly ageing population so governments generally are going to have to look in the future at investing more into aged care facilities
78 weve got an intergenerational challenge ahead of us to support older australians
79 it the care of elderly australians has to be a big focus theres no doubt that greater investments are required
80 when i started here 11 years ago we didnt have a call for it

87 so do you know this rockrock person and what does the photo have to do with this
88 ya see back in the day i worked a few non commercial stations in new york boston and middle america this guy sounds pretty familiar but the degredation of the tape is muckin with my memory its throwing me off a bit it could have been a very good friend of mine using an alias and the tape warble is weird too ya know the whole alias alternate name thing that is the norm these days with so many folk in the online world was pretty much confined to terrestrial broadcast radio back then of course way back to the dawn of broadcast radio there were stage names and ghost writers but with radio the first mass electronic media fake names or alias were really something different the alive quality the live broadcast nature of the medium coupled with the intimacy of the audio in the ear of the listener really shifted persona frontin to a whole new realm
89 mr radio historia phila dr ya know could you just answer the question who is this guy
90 blaaaah ok so do you have any idea wait check that question how about will you be able to figure out who and what and why this recording was dropped here i mean it was literally airmailed and was that an eno track followed by firesign

93 well yah i suppose it was a tough year we flew and jumped a lot and i did hit the trees a few times more than i can ever remember doin in the past i think
94 well yah i would say that at least four or five times a season someone now not always someone sitting in my seats but someone within a few seats gets hit usually you dont see the blood but usually you dont have someone wearing a white silk top to the game silk really shows off blood
95 hey if you dont mind me asking braid how often do you sell your seats what you have had those season tickets for twenty or is it 30 years now
96 actually coop i only sit in my seats if it is the playoffs i sell or give away the seats to every regular season game i clear at least seventy six thousand a year selling the seats
97 yup it is a bit weahd but hey i actually prefer to stand and mill about during the game more action better people watching
98 well ya coop i been here a long time paid my dues sat through hundreds of games of sorrow with the sox have paid well maybe not hundreds but tens of thousands for tickets over the years keeping the season tickets in the fold and now well i deserve to make some of it back whilst the pink hats and silk patrons pay the gs for the seats
99 people watching indeed braid indeed get it while you can
100 hey can i have my antenna back im gettin a lot of echo
101 coop look i gotta go check on my patrons see if the silk splattered one is ok theyre calling me down hey let me just give ya a tip stay out of the tree climbing and try and dig up some of your old airchecks they will probably remind and jog a lot of memories for you and help explain the package delivery
